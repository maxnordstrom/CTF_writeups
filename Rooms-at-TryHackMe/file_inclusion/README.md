# Room: File Inclusion

> ⚠️ Spoiler alert! Do you want to try out the room yourself before you read further? You'll find it at [https://tryhackme.com/room/fileinc](https://tryhackme.com/rooms/fileinc)

I did the room *File Inclusion* which is part of the *Introduction to Web Hacking* module on Try Hack Me. I learned about Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and got to try out some guided examples. LFI and RFI are vulnerabilities that allow attackers to include and execute files – either from the local web server, or from an external source controlled by the attacker. This by manipulating input parameters used in file paths.

The last stage of the room had three challenges set up (well, actually four) and I tackled them solo with the help of the Try Hack Me tutorials leading up to the challenges and some good ol' ChatGPT.
